## Monthly Meetings and Reports

- **Schedule**: We will hold meetings in the first week of each month from August through December to discuss progress and plan for the next steps.

- **Reporting**: After each meeting, students must send the revised slides based on feedback to the advisor, James Chen. These will serve as the monthly report for grading.

## Additional Information

- **Work Commitment**: Research credit hours are equivalent to lab hours. Students are expected to work 3 hours per week for each credit hour. For example, 2 credit hours require 6 hours of work per week.
- **Compensation**: Students will be paid $17 per hour. However, failure to meet the above criteria may result in termination of payment.
- **Early Start and Summer Opportunities**: Students interested in starting the project early or seeking summer training should contact me to discuss available paid internships.
- **Team Dynamics**: For projects involving multiple students, there is no hierarchy based on capabilities, performance, or power, even if a student is designated as the project lead. The project leadâ€™s role is to coordinate the team and keep the project on track, but all members are encouraged to contribute as much as their time and abilities allow.
